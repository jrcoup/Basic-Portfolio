		My name is Jonathan Coup and I am an eletrical engineer at Burns and Mcdonnell. I graduated from KU in 2014 and am now pursuing my MBA at the KU edwards campus where im expected to graduate spring of 2018.</p>
		<p> June 13<sup>th</sup> 2018 my wife Sarah and I brought a new baby boy into the world. His name is Liam and loves to spend time with mom and dad, even through the late hours of the night!</p>
		<p> One of my favorite hobbies is cooking, where last winter I started smoking meat. They now call me Brisket Jonny around the office as my smoked meat is pretty darn good. I hope to start competing soon as I know my stuff stacks pretty high. I also started my own garden this year, planting mostly from seeds. I've got a lot of tomatoes in the back yard along with onions, strawberries, peppers, and herbs. Can't wait to start digging in to home grown produce. I also bake a lot of different breads, I find they go well with smoked meat. My favorite combination so far is pretzel buns with brisket and beer cheese. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.</p>
